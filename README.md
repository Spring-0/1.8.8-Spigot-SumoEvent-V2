# 1.8.8-Spigot-SumoEvent-V2

**SumoEvent** is a robust and customizable Spigot plugin designed to bring the excitement of sumo wrestling into the game.****

## Key Features
+  Match Management: The plugin efficiently manages sumo matches, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience. It automatically handles match countdowns, player queues, and inventory management for participants.
+ Player Queue System: Players can join a queue to wait for their turn in the sumo ring. The plugin ensures fair turn-taking and handles edge cases like players logging out while in the queue.
+ Match Countdown: Before each match, there’s a suspenseful countdown during which players are frozen in place. An anvil sound plays each second, building anticipation for the upcoming match.
+ Inventory Handling: The plugin takes care of players’ inventories during matches. It saves and clears a player’s inventory before teleporting them to the sumo platform, and restores it when the match ends.
+ Potion Effect Clearance: To ensure fair matches, the plugin clears all potion effects from players before they start wrestling.
+ Rewards System: SumoEvent features a configurable rewards system. Server admins can set up rewards for first place and/or second place finishers, as well as individual round match winners. This adds an extra layer of competition and incentive for players.
+ Customizability: SumoEvent is highly customizable. Server admins can set spawn locations and specify the direction players should face when they get teleported to the sumo platform.
+ Configuration: The plugin comes with a configuration file where server admins can easily modify settings to suit their needs. This includes specifying spawn points for players on the sumo platform.

**WorldGuard and WorldEdit Dependencies: SumoEvent requires WorldGuard and WorldEdit to function properly. Server admins need to set up a WorldGuard region over the sumo platform for the plugin to work.**
